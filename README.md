The "Movie_sentiment_analysis using linear regression" uses dataset given by kaggle(train.tsv). I have done this project using google collab and used liner regression model.
I got accuracy of 63.28%.

The other two data set uses IMDB dataset.I have downloaded the dataset from kaggle and converted that into .csv files.

In other two projects i used linear regression and random forest model and i got accuracy of 88.68% and 72.08% respectively.
